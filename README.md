### Introduction
Founded in 2013, Bellabeat is a high-tech company with a global presence, specializing in manufacturing health-focused smart products designed to enhance women’s health. The Bellabeat app is dedicated to gathering data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, empowering users to gain insights into their health and habits, thus aiding them in making healthier choices. The app integrates with Bellabeat's product lineup, including Leaf, Time, and Spring. In terms of marketing strategies, the company prioritizes digital channels such as media advertising, paid search, social media platforms, and YouTube.

The co-founders of Bellabeat have asked the marketing analytics team to help identify trends in consumer data and opportunities for growth. The  primary goals of this project are to extract insights from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) as secondary data to understand trends in consumer usage of other smart devices, leveraging these insights to inform business decisions for BellaBeat. Additionally, recommendations will be developed based on the findings to guide BellaBeat’s marketing strategies for the Bellabeat app.
